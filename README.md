Public view of IOS app Progress

This is currently the home screen of my app

This is what the events look after you scan them.

This is the screen to view all the scans that you save into the system.

I have added scan modes for users, in case your schedule has your name, or it doesnt include dates, or even end times. I understand everyones schedule looks different than others.

This is the screen to make a new scan mode.

You can also edit your current scan modes.
